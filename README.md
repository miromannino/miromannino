I am a Full-Stack Senior Software Engineer from Italy, living in Dubai.

I started coding at age 11. I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the University of Bologna with top honors (4.0 GPA equivalent), while working part-time to support my studies.

I've worked across the private, academic, and public sectorsâ€”ranging from a financial system used by the Italian credit bureau, to award-winning research at New York University, and collaborations on national projects in the UAE, including the Space Agency and Ministry of Health.I currently lead the development of a mission-critical real-time data processing and visualization application.

Outside of work, I've built open-source projects and independent apps, including tools adopted by hundreds of thousands of websites, a product that reached two million users, and a mobile game with over 150,000 downloads.
