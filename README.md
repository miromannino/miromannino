I am a Full-Stack Senior Software Engineer working in the UAE. I have collaborated on projects with the UAE Space Agency and UAE Ministry of Health. I have also worked for New York University, publishing several scientific papers, some of which received awards. In Italy, I worked for CRIF, recognized globally as a leading AI decisioning platform provider.
  
I have created personal projects with over 2 million users, an app with over 150,000 downloads, and open-source projects used by hundreds of thousands of websites.  

Originally from Italy, I earned my MS and BS from the University of Bologna.
